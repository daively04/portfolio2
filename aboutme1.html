 <p class="red"> Skin discoluration. About a year ago, I started waxing my
    upper lip by myself. THAT WAS A MISTAKE! i got this darkness
    around my top lip As you can see, and it stayed there for months.
    But I started using African Black Soap, and a spin brush and facemasks and
    shea butter and my skin started to clear up. I also started drinking more water.
    Just so you know, not everything that works for me will work for you. It is not
    easy to get rid of discoleration in your face and I realize that you are readeing
    this because you want results fast and now. But be patient and explore
    diffirent ways that can work for your skin.</p>

      I never had HORRIBLE skin, but  did always strugle with self confidence when it comes
    to my skin. I have what you would consider combination skin, its oily around my nose
    and under my eyes and as well as my eyebrows. It is dry around my cheeks and chin.</p>
